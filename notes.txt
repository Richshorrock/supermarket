revenue

10 items per section
revenue is from the column in the spiced sheet
profit we can make up its easy

so +1 item from location for every new location, and every minute increases a chance of a second item?

time of day is possible extra variable
maybe also when most profit is actually made? might be a little

Create cost and retail (revenue and profits) as well as 3 fake items per aisle

For every customer, first aisle is +1 of an item from the list randomly ,for every first aisle visit
(So +1 to drinks and fruits if their order is drink-fruit-checkout)

Add a weight for extra minutes spent for 0.2 chance of additional purchase per extra minute

Possibility for stocking and employee forecasting
