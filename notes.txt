revenue

10? items per section
revenue is from the column in the spiced sheet
profit we can make up its easy

so +1 item from location for every new location, and every minute increases a chance of a second item?

time of day is possible extra variable
maybe also when most profit is actually made? might be a little


supermarket

import a dataframe of items, costs, and retail price (fancy later step)
infinite supply so no restock stuff
profit margin is 30%, so revenue x 1.3

we will use a dictionary for each aisle re: prices - we keep the retail price in here

bonuses
time of day + time of day most profit is made


customer

MC based in customer
+1 item for every location shift unique or not except checkout
item is random from supermarket list
and we record the price of each item and which aisle it came from


checkout
= when customer reaches
we calculate sum of each price for each aisle, we are expecting 4 different totals per day, from this we can figure out the total profit from each section per day.

average of profit per customer? bonus stretch goal
