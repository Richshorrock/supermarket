revenue

10 items per section
revenue is from the column in the spiced sheet
profit we can make up its easy

so +1 item from location for every new location, and every minute increases a chance of a second item?

time of day is possible extra variable
maybe also when most profit is actually made? might be a little


supermarket 

import a dataframe of items, costs, and retail price (fancy later step)
infinite supply so no restock stuff
profit margin is 30%, so revenue x 1.3

customer

+1 item for every location shift unique or not except checkout
item is random from supermarket list
